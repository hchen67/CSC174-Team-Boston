        <p>
            My name is Jacob Lee and I am currently a senior at the University of Rochester. I’m majoring in Computer
            Science and plan to graduate this May with a Bachelor of Science. I have a passion for transforming
            innovative ideas to seamless and elegant web applications. When I was a high schooler, I held a plethora of
            different jobs such as yogurt, smoothie, and bubble tea making, chicken serving, and SAT teaching. Two
            summers ago I worked at ClassLink as a Junior Developer Intern and would say that it wasn’t a pleasant
            experience as I did not have much mentorship. However, I still learned a lot by myself through
            stackoverflow and learning from my mistakes. The experience was so awful that I thought I would hate the
            software engineering industry.
        </p>
        <h1> EARLY DAYS </h1>
        <p>
            I thought that the BS program in the University of Rochester is quite challenging as I struggled through
            many of the core courses, most notably CSC 282 and 252. However, I have fortunately gotten through all of
            them and only need one more 200 level course to graduate and have decided to take CSC 261 as this final
            course. For my advanced CS course electives, I decided to concentrate on web and mobile programming as I’ve
            taken CSC 210 and 214. I was born in Korea and spent most of my childhood in underdeveloped countries such
            as the Papua New Guinea and the Philippines. So when I came to the United States in elementary school, I
            was fascinated by the prevalence of computers and their sheer power. All I thought about was the next time
            I could go on a computer and start making stick fights using this old program called Scratch. I think it
            was this stark contrast between being in such underdeveloped countries and coming to the US and seeing all
            this accessible and cool technology that made me interested in programming and computers in general.
        </p>
        <h1> JOB SEARCH </h1>
        <p>
            I had to study data structures and algorithms very extensively and this made me wish I studied harder
            during CSC 172. I submitted more than 200 applications, from which I was ghosted by more than half of them.
            Flying out to the final onsite interviews was a huge hassle as well, as I always had layover flights. These
            interviews also occurred untimely during important exams I had the following week. It was difficult to
            allocate my time to both interview prep and exams as I really wanted to land a job but I had to pass the
            exams to be able to graduate.
        </p>
        <h1> WORK EXPERIENCE </h1>
        <p>
            Last summer, I worked at Ellucian as a Software Developer Intern. Thankfully in this second internship, I
            had a very solid mentorship as it was a much bigger company and had a very enriching and invaluable
            experience. This internship definitely revitalized my love for the industry. Most recently, I worked as a
            Teaching Assistant for CSC 210 and also landed a full-time software engineering job in Boston which I will
            start in July. The interview process for a full-time job was very difficult compared to the search for an
            internship.
