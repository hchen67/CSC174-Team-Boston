        <p>
            I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Rochester studying both Computer Science and
            Anthropology. I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, but have lived in Hawaii (where one of my sisters was born)
            and New Jersey (where my other sister was born). I grew up mostly in Bergen County, NJ, especially within
            the Korean-American enclave of Palisades Park. Growing up I was always fascinated by computers and how they
            worked. I remember milestones like the process of installing my first graphics card, and learning how to
            mod video games.This semester, I am taking CSC174 and CSC 261. I hope to learn more advanced concepts of
            front-end development from 174, and gain a more intricate understanding of relational databases through
            261.

        <h2>Early Days</h2>
        <p>
            I went to high school at Academes@Englewood in Englewood, New Jersey. I had first interaction with web
            development, and computer science as a whole, during my freshman year of high school. It was an “Intro to
            Technology” class, and we made a (very simple) webpage, with only HTML and no CSS. I remember my topic was
            George Washington Carver, and it was a simple webpage with an image and text, with no styling. Senior of
            high school I had my first computer-related internship, at KAB computers. While the job itself involved
            little programming, I was able to get a great sense of the type and scope of software various types of
            businesses need. During that job I shadowed employees as they worked in places like government buildings
            and large businesses.

        <h2>College</h2>
        <p>
            During college, I had initially selected Anthropology as my major, but during sophomore I resolved to get a
            degree in computer science as well. Aside from the core pre-requisites, I had, and am currently taking
            courses focusing on web development. For example, CSC170 was a great exploration of the basics of front-end
            web development, such as HTML and CSS, as well as an excellent introduction to some of the more complex
            ideas, such scripting and web metrics. CSC210 was a course that covered the both the back end and the front
            end aspects of development, and its final project involved making a website from scratch. My group’s final
            project was called Smart Scheduler, and was a web app that automated the scheduling of a user’s event. It
            was a good introduction to the team dynamics of building a website, as well as how different programming
            let’s say a server versus the user interface.
