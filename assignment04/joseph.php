                    was fascinated by the prevalence of computers and their sheer power. All I thought about was the next time
                    I could go on a computer and start making stick fights using this old program called Scratch. I think it
                    was this stark contrast between being in such underdeveloped countries and coming to the US and seeing all
                    this accessible and cool technology that made me interested in programming and computers in general.

    <p>
        I am currently a 4th year student at the University of Rochester studying both Computer Science and
        Anthropology. I was born in Fort Worth, Texas, but have lived in Hawaii (where one of my sisters was born)
        and New Jersey (where my other sister was born). I grew up mostly in Bergen County, NJ, especially within
        the Korean-American enclave of Palisades Park. Growing up I was always fascinated by computers and how they
        worked. I remember milestones like the process of installing my first graphics card, and learning how to
        mod video games.This semester, I am taking CSC174 and CSC 261. I hope to learn more advanced concepts of
        front-end development from 174, and gain a more intricate understanding of relational databases through
        261.

    <h2>Early Days</h2>
    <p>
        I went to high school at Academes@Englewood in Englewood, New Jersey. I had first interaction with web
        development, and computer science as a whole, during my freshman year of high school. It was an “Intro to
        Technology” class, and we made a (very simple) webpage, with only HTML and no CSS. I remember my topic was
        George Washington Carver, and it was a simple webpage with an image and text, with no styling. Senior of
        high school I had my first computer-related internship, at KAB computers. While the job itself involved
        little programming, I was able to get a great sense of the type and scope of software various types of
        businesses need. During that job I shadowed employees as they worked in places like government buildings
        and large businesses.
    </p>
    <h2>College</h2>
    <p>
        During college, I had initially selected Anthropology as my major, but during sophomore I resolved to get a
        degree in computer science as well. Aside from the core pre-requisites, I had, and am currently taking
        courses focusing on web development. For example, CSC170 was a great exploration of the basics of front-end
        web development, such as HTML and CSS, as well as an excellent introduction to some of the more complex
        ideas, such scripting and web metrics. CSC210 was a course that covered the both the back end and the front
        end aspects of development, and its final project involved making a website from scratch. My group’s final
        project was called Smart Scheduler, and was a web app that automated the scheduling of a user’s event. It
        was a good introduction to the team dynamics of building a website, as well as how different programming
        let’s say a server versus the user interface.
