### Triples to define the Ontology
- Each student has a major and a class year
- Each student has classes they have taken at the university
- Each student has had work experience
- Each student has interests outside of classes
### Taxonomy Explanation
The information will be divided into heading and have their information displayed chronologically
### Choreography Explanation
I have arranged the topics in order of level of simplicity to complexity. The most digestible information is the kind of information you'd expect for college students because all college students have a major and class year. All students also have classes they've taken, but because it's a little longer, it comes second. Then because it has felt pretty business-y so far, the next one is all about the work they've done to keep up the theme. Then to end on some levity, the final part is of what they've done outside of specific work and class. Because of the change in tone, I put it into the aside, rather than the main.
